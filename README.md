# Good News API

## Overview
Good News API is an API built with Python (Flask) and Firebase Cloud Firestore that provides users with a few new positive news articles every day. 

Every day, 100 news articles published within the last day from up to 20 different sources across categories such as general, health, science, business, and technology are retrieved from the News API and are sorted by popularity.

The articlesâ€™ headlines are sent to the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics API for sentiment analysis, which returns an overall sentiment of positive, negative, or neutral. Articles are then filtered to only keep those with positive sentiment.

## News Sources 
The API retrieves articles from the following sources: 

  > Buzzfeed, Google News, New York Times, The Huffington Post, CNN, NBC News, The Washington Post, ABC News, BBC News, Next Big Future, New Scientist, Medical News Today, TechCrunch, Ars Technica, Wired, The Next Web, Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal, Business Insider

If you've setup the project locally (see instructions below), feel free to check out the News API documentation to identify the sources you're most interested in and then edit the ```get_raw_news``` method in ```news.py```. 

## Checking out the API 
If you would simply like to take a look at the API, please visit https://good-news-capstone.herokuapp.com/. For instructions on how to set up the project on your machine, please keep reading.

## Setting up the project locally
### News API and Azure API Keys
1. Go to https://newsapi.org/ and follow the instructions to create an account to get an API key.
2. Sign up for a free account at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/.
3. Create a new resource from your portal by clicking on **Create a resource**. Then go to the **AI + Machine Learning** tab and navigate to **Text Analytics** and fill in the information (name, region, resource group, pricing tier).
4. After completing this step, you should be able to go to your resource and follow the instructions on the **Quick Start** page to get started with making API requests. There is also a tab called **Keys and Endpoints** that has your API key and endpoint URL. The following link from the documentation has instructions for how to send a request for sentiment analysis:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-sentiment-analysis?tabs=version-3
4. Once you have your endpoint URL and API key, go to the ```news.py``` file and change the endpoint URL in the ```process_news``` method to the endpoint URL obtained from creating your own text analytics resource.

### Firebase Project Setup 
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/ and click on **Add Project** and follow on screen instructions to create a project. 
2. Once the project has been created, go to **Project Settings** and add a web app to your project.
3. After adding a web app to your project, go to the **Service Accounts** tab, select Python and then click on **Generate new private key**. These keys will be used to create the [Python .env file](#Create-an-env-file).

### Create Firestore Database 
1. Go to the Cloud Firestore tab and click on **Create Database**.
2. Start in test mode and select your region (note: it may already be selected for you).

### Enable Firebase Authentication 
1. Go to the **Authentication** tab and click on **Get Started**.
2. Go to the **Sign-in method** tab and **enable Google sign in**. 

### Get the code

```shell=bash
# Clone the code
git clone https://github.com/roshni-patel/good-news-api.git 

# Go into the code folder
cd good-news-api

# Setup the virtual environment and install the requirements 
python3 -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Create an env file

```

### Running Locally 
* Start the Python server within your virtual environment using python app.py and it should be available on http://localhost:5000 


### Deploying to Heroku
